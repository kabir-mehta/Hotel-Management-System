# Hotel-Management-System

Stimulated a hotel environment where the different entities like an admin, a hotel manager, tables customers & waiters are represented as processes.
Used OS concepts such as Linux commands, process creation, inter-process communication, etc. to create the hotel management system.
All programs are POSIX-compliant C programs.
